h2. FacebookAuthDao

Plugin generates an Dao, after calling @s2-init-facebook@, and put it into your @conf/spring/resources.groovy@
and @Config.groovy@. Actually it's an 'dumb' dao implementations, you have to rewrite it to follow your
data structures (please take a look at JavaDoc for more details)
