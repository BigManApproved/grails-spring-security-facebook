h1. Beans

h2. FacebookAuthDao

Plugin generates an Dao, after calling @s2-init-facebook@, and put it into your @conf/spring/resources.groovy@
and @Config.groovy@. Actually it's an 'dumb' dao implementations, you have to rewrite it to follow your
data structures:

h3. FacebookUser findUser(long uid)

Called on every authorization attempt. If must return existing user (instance of FaceboobUser domain) if user is already exists
in database. Or null if user not exists yet, it will be created at this case.

h3. FacebookUser create(FacebookAuthToken token)

Called when authenticated Facebook User not exists yet (when findUser has returned null value). It's the place to 
prepare all domain objects for your user, fill user roles, fetch extra data from Facebook API (using profided token.accessToken), etc.
And return just create user.

h3. void update(FacebookUser user)

Called when user details has changed (accessToken, session data, etc). If you don't using this data (it not using Facebook API) - you can skip this, make just empty method.

h3. Object getPrincipal(FacebookUser user)

Called to get actual user. Useful when you're storing Facebook User details in different model, related to main user domain. If your user and facebook user are same objects - just return it 

h3. Collection<GrantedAuthority> getRoles(FacebookUser user)

Return roles list for user related to specified Facebook user


h1. FAQ

h2. How it works?

Facebook setup special cookies after successful authorization, so this plugin just handles this cookies, and your
user will be automatically logged in to your webapp when she logged in into Facebook (and she has clicked
'Connect with Facebook' before)

h2. How to get user email?

{note}
First of all: you need 'email' permission on connect @<facebookAuth:connect permissions="email"/>@
{note}

Add Spring Social lib into your classpath, by adding following dependencies into your @BuildConfig.groovy@:
{code}
compile 'org.springframework.social:spring-social-core:1.0.0.RELEASE'
compile 'org.springframework.social:spring-social-facebook:1.0.0.RELEASE'
{code}

and then you can use Facebook API. For example you can fetch user's email on user cretion step:
{code}
Facebook facebook = new FacebookTemplate(token.accessToken)
FacebookProfile fbProfile = facebook.userOperations().userProfile
String email = fbProfile.getEmail()
{code}
