h2. FacebookAuthDao

Plugin generates an Dao, after calling @s2-init-facebook@, and put it into your @conf/spring/resources.groovy@
and @Config.groovy@. Actually it's an 'dumb' dao implementations, you have to rewrite it to follow your
data structures (please take a look at JavaDoc for more details)

h1. FAQ

h2. How it works?

Facebook setup special cookies after successful authorization, so this plugin just handles this cookies, and your
user will be automatically logged in to your webapp when she logged in into Facebook (and she has clicked
'Connect with Facebook' before)

h2. How to get user email?

{note}
First of all: you need 'email' permission on connect @<facebookAuth:connect permissions="email"/>@
{note}

Add Spring Social lib into your classpath, by adding following dependencies into your @BuildConfig.groovy@:
{code}
compile 'org.springframework.social:spring-social-core:1.0.0.RELEASE'
compile 'org.springframework.social:spring-social-facebook:1.0.0.RELEASE'
{code}

and then you can use Facebook API. For example you can fetch user's email on user cretion step:
{code}
Facebook facebook = new FacebookTemplate(token.accessToken)
FacebookProfile fbProfile = facebook.userOperations().userProfile
String email = fbProfile.getEmail()
{code}
