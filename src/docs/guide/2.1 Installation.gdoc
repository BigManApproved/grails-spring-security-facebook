h3. Install plugin

Basically it's just a:

{code}
grails install-plugin spring-security-core
grails s2-quickstart
grails install-plugin spring-security-facebook
grails s2-init-facebook
{code}

Last step `s2-init-facebook` is optional, useful only if you need an step-by-step wizard to make configuration.
